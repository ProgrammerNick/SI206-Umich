# If you used Generative AI, say that you used it and also how you used it.
# I used generative AI to help me with the randomization portion of the project. I wasn't exactly sure how to randomize the answer.
# I also used it to help me with understanding how to fix the for loop when it came to printing answer frequencies, by transforming it into a set, it only looked for unique answers, which got me my desired output.
